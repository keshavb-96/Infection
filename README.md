# Infection

To test the program, simply run it and pass in the path of a .g file when prompted and then follow the menu to test either Total Infection
or Limited Infection. The folder test_graphs contains 3 unique .g files that can be used for testing. Should you be interested to create
additional .g files the structure of the .g files is described in the document "Format of the .g files" in the Infection folder.
